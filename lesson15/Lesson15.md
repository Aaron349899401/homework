There are three ways to do iterations:

1. [While Loops](https://mrparkonline.gitbook.io/guide-to-high-school-computer-science/python-programming/iterations/introduction-to-while-loops)
2. [For Loops](https://mrparkonline.gitbook.io/guide-to-high-school-computer-science/python-programming/iterations/introduction-to-for-loops)
3. [Recursion](https://mrparkonline.gitbook.io/guide-to-high-school-computer-science/python-programming/introduction-to-algorithmic-thinking/recursion)

In this lesson, we are learning how to solve the following problem:
    
You are to create a program that determines how many paint cans we'd need.

- Each plank of the fence requires one paint can.
- Your supplier only sells paint cans by the dozen (12) for $14.95. 
- There are 3 fenced sections, and their length will be denoted by a series of 'F' for each fence plank.

__Output:__ how many cans you'd need, how many paint cans you have leftover, and how much it would cost.

```
Sample Input:
FF
FFFF
FFFFFF

Sample Output:
12
0
14.95
```

### Problem Overview

Given 3 inputs of strings composed of the F character, determine the number of paint cans needed, cans leftover, and the total cost.

### You will learn:

- How to use ```len()``` in Python
- How to import and use the ```ceil()``` in Python

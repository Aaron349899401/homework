### Problem Overview

This is a classic computer science problem. There is a great video on it by: __Tom Scott__: ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&pp=ygUIZml6emJ1eno%3D)). _Please check it out_.

FizzBuzz is counting from 1 to 50 and outputing the number; however, certain numbers will output fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz.
- if the number is a multiple of three: print 'Fizz',
- if the number is a multiple of five: print 'Buzz',
- if they are multiples of both: print 'FizzBuzz'
- otherwise print the number

### You will learn:

- ```range()``` to generate an iterable sequence of integers
- Use the modulus operator
- Use a for loop on an iterable sequence

The program takes 2 user inputs:
    1. The amount of money you started with
    2. A string composed of 'b' and 'c'

    Example: "bcbcbc" contains 3 big cookies and 3 normal cookies

The program should output:

- Number of total cookies sold
- Profit (which is calculated as profit = sales  - cost of cookie)
- Total amount of money after selling cookies

Cost of a single normal Cookie: __$1.25__


Cost of a single Big cookie: __$2.00__
   
Cost to make a normal cookie: *$0.50*

Cost to make a big cookie: *$0.75*

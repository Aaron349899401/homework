In this lesson, we are learning how to solve the [Tournament Selection from CCC 2016](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc16j1).

Each player in a tournament plays six games. There are no ties. The tournament director places the players in groups based on the results of games as follows:

- if a player wins 5 or 6 games, they are placed in Group 1
- if a player wins 3 or 4 games, they are placed in Group 2
- if a player wins 1 or 2 games, they are placed in Group 3
- if a player does not win any games, they are eliminated from the tournament.

Write a program to determine which group a player is placed in.

### Problem Overview

Given 6 string inputs of either ```W``` or ```L```, we are to determine which group they fall under for the tournament.

### You will learn:

- How to use a for-each loop in Python
- How to use the ```range()``` function in Python

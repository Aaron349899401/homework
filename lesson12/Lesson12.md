In this lesson, we are learning how to solve the [Triangle Times question](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15j1).

Given a Triangle:
    
- If all three angles are 60, it is a _Equilateral_ triangle.
- If the three angles add up to 180 and exactly two of the angles are the same, it is a _Isosceles_ triangle.
- If the three angles add up to 180 and no two angles are the same, it is a _Scalene_ triangle.

### Problem Overview

Given 3 angles of a potential triangle, determine the type of the triangle: Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene.

### You will learn:

- Nested if statements
- Using sum() function
- Comparison chaining: ``` a == b == c ```
- proper use of ```and``` operator in Python
